# **Horizon React**

This is the frontend for my Solana trading bot, designed to bring an interactive web interface to a project that was previously backend-only.

## **What This Project Does**

I already have a Solana trading bot with copy trading features and more, but until now, you could only interact with it through the backend. This project bridges that gap by creating a **frontend web interface** that connects everything together, making it more interactive and user-friendly.

## **Current Features**

- **Dashboard Panel** – Manage settings like:
  - Token Mint
  - Amount
  - Slippage
  - Fees
- **Owned Tokens Panel** – Displays tokens in the wallet with **Sell 50% / Sell 100%** buttons (currently decorative but planned for full functionality).

## **Future Plans**

- Fully working **buy/sell functionality**
- Live service for **local & public deployment**
- Optimized to **save on third-party platform fees**

The project is still in development, but I’ve made solid progress in less than a day. More updates coming soon!
